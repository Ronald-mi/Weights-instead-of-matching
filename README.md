A few notes regarding the variables in "panel_data1.csv"

 - "indep" is the outcome variable
 - "sector_eu_without" is the variable that indicates which of the treated groups the respondent belongs to
 - "ID" indicates the respondent. E.g. 1_1 is the same respondent over the four data waves. 1_2 is a different respondent, but which has the same characteristics regarding the variables "sex, age_group, education and sector_eu". The first number before "_" indicates a unique combination of these four variables, the number after "_" indicates the number of the respondent with that unique combination.
   **Note: this is a pseudo-panel.
 - "PESO" is the variable that ensures the representativeness of one of the four data waves (the other three data waves are already representative of the population).
 - All other variables are just control variables or possible confounders.
